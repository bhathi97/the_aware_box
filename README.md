# THE_AWARE_BOX

This project aims to develop a security box that ensures the safekeeping of valuable objects while maintaining their optimal condition. The box incorporates an Ultrasonic sensor and a DHT11 sensor, and the readings from these sensors can be accessed through a mobile application.

## Box Setup
The Ultrasonic sensor is strategically positioned on one side of the box. This sensor emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By calculating the distance between the sensor and the object, it can detect if an object is present inside the box.

## Object Detection
When an object is placed inside the box, the Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance between itself and the object. Any change in the distance reading indicates that the object has been moved or tampered with. This information is transmitted to the mobile application, allowing users to monitor the security of their valuable items.

## Environmental Monitoring
In addition to object detection, the box utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and temperature within the storage environment. This data is essential for maintaining the optimal conditions required for preserving the object's quality and preventing any damage due to unfavorable environmental factors.

By integrating the Ultrasonic and DHT11 sensors with a mobile application, this security box provides users with real-time updates on object presence and environmental conditions. This ensures that valuable items are kept safe, while also promoting their longevity and preserving their quality.
