# THE_AWARE_BOX

## This project aims to make a security box to put some valuable object in safe and healthy 
condition. A box with Ultrasonic sensor, DHT 11 sensors are using. Ultrasonic and DHT 11 sensor 
readings can read using a mobile application. Ultrasonic sensor set in a side of the box. When there is
an object in the box, get the distance between the object and the sensor to an app. If there is a change 
of distance reading it means object is moved therefore it can use to keep the object safe. DHT 11 is 
using to read humidity and the temperature in the box and using this data the object can keep in good
condition.
